# AROUND TOWN

## Place holder static site for a future Phalcon PHP project

- This is a static site generate with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- Package management handled with `npm`


To install GatsbyJS

`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

Install packages

`npm i`


Launch the server

`gatsby develop`

This is built intirely with ReactJS, I know cool right. If you have any experience with ReactJS the folder structure and flow will seem pretty typical. If not, I recommend you run through a GatsbyJS tutorial, just to get the basic flow.

If you have questions, feel free to message me.
