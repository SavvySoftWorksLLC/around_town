        <p className="about--answer">
          We are looking to create a community event calendar based on interests. Where businesses or groups can post events with tags relevant to their event. Such as a coffee shop hosting an open mic night. Could post an event with the tags coffee, music, andopen mic. Then when a user searches for music he would see the open mic night in their feed.
